It consists of all the constituents of a web app

The main Pipeline model file is in the "app" folder.
Put the media and the .gitignore in the .gitignore file so that they won't be commited.

TODO:
1. Improve the back end and include all the future implementations mentioned in the pitch deck and also to rectify the errors which we spotted before.
2. Improve the front end using bootstrap. Please take care of the forms.py while editing the form and the button. You can watch the last part of course 
   for editing the forms.py for the button. Instructor has mentioned some points in it.
   
Also, use this readme file to update about what changes you have done to the code. It'll be helpful for others.
